# Hey, I’m Adan — welcome to my GitHub!

</div>

I’m a data-minded problem-solver with a passion for figuring things out, spotting patterns, and stepping up with ideas. Whether it’s a messy dataset, an underperforming campaign, or a business process that could run smoother — I like to be the person who says,  
**“I’ve seen this before, here’s what we should do.”**

My background blends marketing, analytics, and data science with hands-on work in housing operations and small business strategy. I’ve built churn models, visual dashboards, segmentation projects, and NLP tools — all grounded in real-world needs. I’m not just learning how to use Python, SQL, or Tableau — I’m learning how to **use them to solve actual problems.**

- 🔭 **Currently building**: A portfolio that shows how I think, not just what I code — with Python notebooks, visualizations, and case-style projects.
- 🌱 **Learning more about**: Machine learning, generative AI, marketing automation, and creative use cases for data in business and social impact.
- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on**: Projects that need data-backed decision-making, creative insight, and someone willing to ask “what if we tried it this way?”
- 🤝 **Open to opportunities**: Entry-level roles in analytics, marketing, strategy, or data science where I can grow and help teams make smarter calls.
- 💬 **Let’s talk about**: Data storytelling, marketing strategy, predictive analytics, or anything that turns raw data into action.
