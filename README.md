# Hey, I’m Adan — welcome to my GitHub!

</div>

I’m a data-minded generalist who loves turning information into insights and ideas into impact. My background blends marketing, analytics, data science, and public service — and I use that range to explore real-world problems from multiple angles.

I’m especially passionate about building projects that connect technical skills with strategic thinking. Whether it’s Python notebooks for churn modeling or Tableau dashboards that visualize campaign results, I’m always looking for ways to make data approachable and actionable.

- 🔭 **Currently working on**: Expanding my portfolio with projects in Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning — including segmentation, classification, and NLP-based analysis.
- 🌱 **Learning**: More advanced ML techniques, generative AI, and creative applications of data in marketing, healthcare, and business intelligence.
- 👯 **Open to collaborate on**: Projects where data can help people — especially in areas like marketing strategy, social impact, analytics, or creative tech.
- 🤝 **Looking for opportunities**: Entry-level roles or team-based projects where I can grow, contribute, and help connect the dots between data and decisions.
- 💬 **Ask me about**: Python, SQL, Tableau, machine learning, marketing analytics, or how data can tell better stories.

Outside of coding, I enjoy bridging technical work with storytelling and communication. Whether you’re here to browse my projects or collaborate on something new — thanks for stopping by!
